**Introduction to Snowflake (UI)**

**Chapter 1 - Snowflake Essentials**

* **Lesson 1.1 - Cloud Data Warehousing and Snowflake's Edge**
   * Learner will be able to define cloud data warehousing and explain its advantages over traditional data warehousing, including scalability, pay-as-you-go pricing, and ease of management.
   * Learner will be able to compare and contrast Snowflake's architecture with traditional systems and other cloud competitors, emphasizing key advantages such as the separation of storage and compute, and its multi-cluster shared data architecture.
   * **Functions/Concepts/Terminology:** Cloud data warehouse, scalability, pay-as-you-go, separation of storage and compute, multi-cluster shared data architecture.

* **Lesson 1.2 - Introducing Snowsight**
   * Learner will be able to navigate the core components of the Snowsight interface: Databases, Warehouses, Worksheets, History, and Data Marketplace.
   * Learner will be able to explain how these components are used in a typical data analysis and visualization workflow. 
   * **Functions/Concepts/Terminology:** Snowsight, Databases, Warehouses, Worksheets, History, Data Marketplace, Data Analysis, Data Visualization.

* **Lesson 1.3 - Working with Worksheets and Queries**
    * Learner will be able to write, execute, and save basic SQL queries in the Worksheet editor.
    * Learner will be able to use Snowsight's UI functionalities (sorting, filtering, basic statistics) to analyze and gain insights from query results.
    * Learner will be able to explain the concept of "sessions" in Snowflake and how roles determine data access and permissions.
    * **Functions/Concepts/Terminology:** Worksheets, Query Execution, Query Results, Session Context, Roles.

**Chapter 2 - Mastering Snowsight Basics**

* **Lesson 2.1 - Managing Database Objects**
  * Learner will be able to understand the hierarchical structure of databases, schemas, tables, and views in Snowflake.
  * Learner will be able to retrieve and interpret metadata about database objects, explaining its importance for data management.
  * Learner will be able to use Snowsight's search functionality to quickly locate specific database objects.
  * **Functions/Concepts/Terminology:** Object hierarchy, Metadata, Data Preview, Universal Search

* **Lesson 2.2 - Getting Data into Snowflake**
  * Learner will be able to load data into Snowflake using the Snowsight web interface and understand the role of virtual warehouses in this process.
  * Learner will be able to explore and assess data quality (e.g., identifying null values, duplicates, or unexpected patterns) using Snowsight's built-in visualizations and data filtering options.
  * **Functions/Concepts/Terminology:** Data loading, virtual warehouses, data quality, data profiling, basic data exploration

* **Lesson 2.3 - Data Fundamentals**
  * Learner will be able to explain common data file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) and their use cases.
  * Learner will be able to understand the concepts of internal vs external data sources, staging tables, and loading data directly from cloud storage locations in Snowflake.
  * Learner will be able to describe the basic steps of the data loading process in Snowflake, including bulk loading, continuous loading (Snowpipe), and error handling.
  * **Functions/Concepts/Terminology:** CSV, JSON, staging tables, bulk loading, continuous loading (Snowpipe), internal/external data sources, error handling 

* **Lesson 2.4 - Beyond the Basics**
   * Learner will be able to understand the concept of data connectors and how they simplify data integration with Snowflake.
   * Learner will be able to identify advanced Snowflake capabilities (Snowpark, data lakes, data sharing, ML workloads), and provide examples of how they can be used in real-world scenarios.
   * **Functions/Concepts/Terminology:** Data connectors, Integrations, Snowpark, Data Lake, Data sharing, ML workloads.
