Introduction to Snowflake (UI)

Chapter 1 - Snowflake Essentials
Lesson 1.1 - Cloud Data Warehousing and Snowflake's Edge
Learner will be able to define cloud data warehousing and explain how its scalability and pay-as-you-go model, etc., provide advantages over traditional data warehousing.
Learner will be able to compare and contrast Snowflake's architecture with traditional systems and cloud competitors, emphasising key advantages (with real-world use cases).
Functions/Concepts/Terminology: Cloud data warehouse, scalability, pay-as-you-go, separation of storage and compute, multi-cluster shared data architecture.

Lesson 1.2 - Introducing Snowsight
Learner will be able to navigate through core components of the Snowsight interface: Projects, Worksheets, and Dashboards. Access the Data & Marketplace section.
Learner will be able to explain how the above sections fit into a typical data analysis and visualisation workflow.
Learner will be able to organise work using projects within Snowsight.
Functions/Concepts/Terminology: Projects, Worksheets, Dashboards, Databases, Schemas, Tables, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Collaboration

Lesson 1.3 - Account Basics and Warehouses
Learner will be able to view and update basic account information.
Learner will be able to explain the importance of roles in Snowflake for controlling data and functionality access.
Learner will be able to understand the concept of virtual warehouses, start, suspend, and resize them based on workload requirements.
Functions/Concepts/Terminology: Monitoring, Accounts, User Profiles, Billing information, Roles, Virtual warehouse, compute resources, suspend, resume, resize.


Chapter 2 - Mastering Snowsight Basics
Lesson 2.1 - Working with Worksheets and Queries
Learner will be able to write, execute, and save basic SQL queries in the SQL editor.
Learner will be able to utilise UI functionalities (sorting, filtering, basic statistics) to analyse and gain insights from tabular query results.
Learner will be able to explain 'sessions' in Snowflake and how roles determine data access and permissions within a session.
Functions/Concepts/Terminology: Worksheets, Query Execution, Query Results, Session Context, Roles.

Lesson 2.2 - Data Visualization with Snowsight
Learner will be able to convert SQL query results into various visualisations (e.g., bar charts, line charts, scatter plots) to represent data graphically.
Learner will be able to apply filtering and aggregation options to refine the data displayed in charts.
Learner will be able to create dashboards that combine multiple tiles representing different queries to provide a comprehensive view of data.
Functions/Concepts/Terminology: Charts, dashboards, tiles, visualisation types.

Lesson 2.3 - Managing Database Objects
Learner will be able to navigate the structure of databases, schemas, tables, and views.
Learner will be able to describe the hierarchical relationships between databases, schemas, tables, and views in Snowflake.
Learner will be able to retrieve and interpret metadata about a schema, explaining its importance for data management.
Learner will be able to use Snowsight's search functionality to efficiently locate specific databases, schemas, tables, or views.
Functions/Concepts/Terminology: Object hierarchy, Metadata, Data Preview, Universal Search

Lesson 2.4 -  Beyond the Basics
Learner will be able to load data into Snowflake using the Snowsight web interface.
Learner will be able to describe the concept of data connectors and other data loading options in Snowflake (e.g., bulk loading, continuous loading), highlighting integration capabilities.
Learner will be able to identify advanced Snowflake capabilities (Snowpark, data lakes, data sharing, ML workloads), providing examples of how they solve real-world data problems.
Functions/Concepts/Terminology: Data loading, Data connectors, Integrations, Data Platform, Snowpark, Data Lake, Data sharing, ML workloads.
