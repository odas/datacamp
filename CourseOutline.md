Introduction to Snowflake (UI)

Chapter 1 - Snowflake Essentials
Lesson 1.1 - Cloud Data Warehousing and Snowflake's Edge
Learner will be able to define cloud data warehousing and explain how its scalability and pay-as-you-go model, etc., provide advantages over traditional data warehousing.
Learner will be able to compare and contrast Snowflake's architecture with traditional systems and cloud competitors, emphasising key advantages (with real-world use cases % how its separation of storage and compute extends relational database concepts).
Functions/Concepts/Terminology: Cloud data warehouse, scalability, pay-as-you-go, separation of storage and compute, multi-cluster shared data architecture.

Lesson 1.2 - Introducing Snowsight
Learner will be able to navigate through core components of the Snowsight interface: Projects, Worksheets, and Dashboards. Access the Data & Marketplace section.
Learner will be able to explain how the above sections fit into a typical data analysis and visualisation workflow.
Learner will be able to organise work using projects within Snowsight.
Functions/Concepts/Terminology: Projects, Worksheets, Dashboards, Databases, Schemas, Tables, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Collaboration

Lesson 1.3 - Working with Worksheets and Queries
Learner will be able to write, execute, and save basic SQL queries in the SQL editor.
Learner will be able to utilise UI functionalities (sorting, filtering, basic statistics) to analyse and gain insights from tabular query results.
Learner will be able to explain 'sessions' in Snowflake and how roles determine data access and permissions within a session.
Functions/Concepts/Terminology: Worksheets, Query Execution, Query Results, Session Context, Roles.

Chapter 2 - Mastering Snowsight Basics
Lesson 2.1 - Managing Database Objects
Learner will be able to navigate the structure of databases, schemas, tables, and views.
Learner will be able to describe the hierarchical relationships between databases, schemas, tables, and views in Snowflake.
Learner will be able to retrieve and interpret metadata about a schema, explaining its importance for data management.
Learner will be able to use Snowsight's search functionality to efficiently locate specific databases, schemas, tables, or views.
Functions/Concepts/Terminology: Object hierarchy, Metadata, Data Preview, Universal Search

Lesson 2.2 - Getting Data into Snowflake
Learner will be able to load data into Snowflake using the Snowsight web interface. Include the need for virtual warehouses and the importance of suspending them for cost efficiency.
Learner will be able to explore data/assess data quality (e.g., identifying null values, duplicates, or unexpected patterns) through visualisations and tabular data filtering options built into Snowsight. 
Functions/Concepts/Terminology: Data loading, data qualitty, virtual warehouses

Lesson 2.3 - Data Fundamentals
Learner will be able to explain common data file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) and their use cases.
Learner will be able to understand the concept of staging tables and their role in preparing data before loading into final tables.
Learner will be able to understand the basic steps of the data loading process in Snowflake, from file selection to error handling.
Learner will be able to understand the difference between internal and external data sources/stages in Snowflake.
Learner will be able to understand how Snowflake can query data from external sources (e.g., cloud storage locations) without loading.
Functions/Concepts/Terminology:  CSV, JSON, data transformation, error handling, data connectors, bulk loading, continuous loading (Snowpipe)
 
Lesson x.x - Working with Semi-structured Data
Learner will be able to work with semi-structured data (JSON) in Snowflake.
Learner will be able to query and extract data from JSON objects.
Functions/Concepts/Terminology: JSON, JSON path expressions, arrays, objects
  
Lesson 2.4 -  Beyond the Basics
Learner will be able to describe the concept of data connectors and other data loading options in Snowflake (e.g., bulk loading, continuous loading), highlighting how connectors simplify the integration process.
Learner will be able to identify advanced Snowflake capabilities (Snowpark, data lakes, data sharing, ML workloads), providing examples of how they solve real-world data problems.
Functions/Concepts/Terminology: Data loading, Data connectors, Integrations, Data Platform, Snowpark, Data Lake, Data sharing, ML workloads.
