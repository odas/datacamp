**Introduction to Snowflake (UI)**

**Chapter 1 - Snowflake Essentials**

* **Lesson 1.1 - Cloud Data Warehousing and Snowflake's Edge**
   * Learner will be able to define cloud data warehousing and explain how its scalability and pay-as-you-go model, etc., provide advantages over traditional data warehousing. 
   * Learner will be able to compare and contrast Snowflake's architecture with traditional systems and cloud competitors, emphasising key advantages (with real-world use cases **and** how its separation of storage and compute extends relational database concepts). 
   * **Functions/Concepts/Terminology:** Cloud data warehouse, scalability, pay-as-you-go, separation of storage and compute, multi-cluster shared data architecture.

* **Lesson 1.2 - Introducing Snowsight**
   * Learner will be able to navigate through core components of the Snowsight interface: Projects, Worksheets, and Dashboards. Access the Data & Marketplace section.
   * Learner will be able to explain how the above sections fit into a typical data analysis and visualisation workflow.
   * Learner will be able to organise work using projects within Snowsight. 
   * **Functions/Concepts/Terminology:** Projects, Worksheets, Dashboards, Databases, Schemas, Tables, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Collaboration 

* **Lesson 1.3 - Working with Worksheets and Queries**
   * Learner will be able to write, execute, and save basic SQL queries in the SQL editor.
   * Learner will be able to explain 'sessions' in Snowflake and how roles determine data access and permissions within a session.
   * **Functions/Concepts/Terminology:** Worksheets, Query Execution, Query Results, Session Context, Roles.

**Chapter 2 - Mastering Snowsight Basics**

* **Lesson 2.1 - Managing Database Objects**
   * Learner will be able to navigate the structure of databases, schemas, tables, and views.
   * Learner will be able to describe the hierarchical relationships between databases, schemas, tables, and views in Snowflake.
   * Learner will be able to retrieve and interpret metadata about a schema, explaining its importance for data management.
   * Learner will be able to use Snowsight's search functionality to efficiently locate specific databases, schemas, tables, or views.
   * **Functions/Concepts/Terminology:** Object hierarchy, Metadata, Data Preview, Universal Search

* **Lesson 2.2 - Getting Data into Snowflake**
   * Learner will be able to load data into Snowflake using the Snowsight web interface. Include the need for virtual warehouses and the importance of suspending them for cost efficiency.
   * Learner will be able to explore data/assess data quality (e.g., identifying null values, duplicates, or unexpected patterns) through visualisations and tabular data filtering options built into Snowsight.
   * **Functions/Concepts/Terminology:** Data loading, virtual warehouses, data quality, data profiling, basic data exploration 

* **Lesson 2.3 - Data Fundamentals** 
   * Learner will be able to understand the basic steps of the data loading process in Snowflake, from file selection to error handling, including bulk loading vs continuous loading, internal vs external data sources in Snowflake.
   * Learner will be able to understand the concept of staging tables and their role in preparing data before loading into final tables. 
   * Learner will be able to understand how Snowflake can query data from external sources (e.g., cloud storage locations) without loading. 
   * **Functions/Concepts/Terminology:** CSV, JSON, staging tables, error handling, bulk loading, continuous loading (Snowpipe), internal/external data sources

* **Lesson 2.4 - Beyond the Basics**
   * Learner will be able to describe the concept of data connectors, highlighting how they simplify the integration process and summarize key data loading options in Snowflake.
   * Learner will be able to identify advanced Snowflake capabilities (Snowpark, data lakes, data sharing, ML workloads), providing examples of how they solve real-world data problems. 
   * **Functions/Concepts/Terminology:** Data loading, Data connectors, Integrations, Data Platform, Snowpark, Data Lake, Data sharing, ML workloads.
